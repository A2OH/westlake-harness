# org.billthefarmer.editor 1.98 → OpenHarmony: API shim gap map

Provider: Westlake `corpus2-fixes` @ `6c300b3bd0`; OH board: OpenHarmony 6.1.0.31, arm64, SELinux enforcing policy as loaded. Target SDK 35.

## Summary

| Category | How it reaches OH | Rows | Gaps | Effort profile |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Java framework API | APK dex references − Westlake boot jars, filtered by API level | 2 | 2 | 2×verify |
| System services | getSystemService name → AOSP fetcher/binder → Westlake provision → OH subsystem | 3 | 1 | 1×verify |
| Keystore & crypto providers | JCA provider names the code selects → providers the Westlake runtime installs → OH HUKS | 0 | 0 | — |
| Package manager & manifest | manifest features and PackageManager calls → Westlake PM semantics | 1 | 1 | 1×verify |
| Activity, window & process contracts | what system_server would answer, answered in-process by Westlake in direct launch → white-box probes | 1 | 1 | 1×L |
| Windows & surfaces | how the first screen renders → whether it needs a surface of its own → OH window/surface model | 0 | 0 | — |
| Framework natives | platform classes the app uses → their native methods → libraries the runtime registers them from | 0 | 0 | — |
| Java APIs called from native code | JNIEnv FindClass/Get*ID names in packaged .so → Westlake boot jars | 0 | 0 | — |
| Native platform symbols | packaged .so imports → OpenHarmony plus the NDK Westlake packages (package / libc-abi / weld / absence) | 0 | 0 | — |
| Native loading & packaging | how the libraries are packaged → what the OH linker can map | 1 | 1 | 1×verify |
| Process sandbox & policy | objects the code creates → what OH SELinux lets an app create | 0 | 0 | — |
| External services & SDK behaviour | SDKs that expect Google services or probe the device | 0 | 0 | — |

Effort: **XS** hours: configuration, labelling, or forwarding one symbol; **S** about a day: a truthful local answer, a missing export, or a handful of methods; **M** days: an Android facade over an existing OH capability, for the methods this app calls; **L** weeks: port or build a subsystem or bridge; **OH** needs an OpenHarmony platform change (policy, kernel, system ability): outside Westlake; **verify** implemented according to source; run the conformance probe before trusting it

## Rows that have blocked an app at startup before

From the blockers ledger: gaps this app has in common with an app that died on them.

| Row | Verdict | Blocked |
|---|---|---|
| `wv:renderer-process` | missing | burgerking (blind-bk), open |

## Java framework API

_APK dex references − Westlake boot jars, filtered by API level_

| Item | Verdict | Class | Effort | OH touchpoint | Shim / evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| App framework | hollow-candidate | C9 | verify | ability_runtime | check each hollow body against AOSP<br>android.app.Activity.onActionModeStarted |
| Java library | hollow-candidate | C9 | verify | none (library code inside Westlake) | check each hollow body against AOSP<br>java.io.OutputStream.close |

## System services

_getSystemService name → AOSP fetcher/binder → Westlake provision → OH subsystem_

| Item | Verdict | Class | Effort | OH touchpoint | Shim / evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| print | unresolved | CU | verify | print_service | trace the helper's binder; then treat as null, inert or supplied<br>1 call sites, e.g. org.billthefarmer.editor.Editor$3.onPageFinished `SystemServiceRegistry.java:893` |
| input_method | supplied | C0 | verify | inputmethod_framework | none<br>1 call sites, e.g. org.billthefarmer.editor.Editor.lambda$setListeners$4$org-billthefarmer-editor-Editor `framework/core/java/OHServiceManager.java:105` |
| layout_inflater | supplied | C0 | verify | unmapped | none<br>3 call sites, e.g. org.billthefarmer.editor.Editor.gotoDialog `SystemServiceRegistry.java:593` |

## Package manager & manifest

_manifest features and PackageManager calls → Westlake PM semantics_

| Item | Verdict | Class | Effort | OH touchpoint | Shim / evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Content providers installed at bind (1, initOrder honoured) | unverified | CU | verify | none | install every main-process provider in initOrder before Application.onCreate<br>FileProvider — probe: `probes/provider-manifest` |

## Activity, window & process contracts

_what system_server would answer, answered in-process by Westlake in direct launch → white-box probes_

| Item | Verdict | Class | Effort | OH touchpoint | Shim / evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| WebView's renderer runs in an isolated service process | missing | C4 | L | process spawn (appspawn): an isolated Android service process with its own sandbox | host the renderer: spawn an isolated child and bind Chromium's SandboxedProcessService over a local channel; or build the framework with the update-service flag off so WebView runs single-process<br>app constructs WebViews and calls 4 WebView methods `frameworks-base/core/java/android/webkit/WebViewDelegate.java:215` |

## Native loading & packaging

_how the libraries are packaged → what the OH linker can map_

| Item | Verdict | Class | Effort | OH touchpoint | Shim / evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Runtime libraries its own loader will not open (libicu_jni.so) | unresolved | C3 | verify | Runtime.nativeLoad in the runtime's own OpenJDK stub | compare the staged library's methods against the tables the runtime's own stubs register (art-build/stubs, registerNativesOrSkip) and ship any remainder under a name the filter does not match. ship the library under a name none of those substrings match, or narrow the stub to the libraries the runtime really does link in. A load that reports success it did not perform cannot be told from one that worked, so nothing downstream can detect this.<br>a property of the runtime, not of this app: it holds for every app it launches `art-build/stubs/openjdk_stub.c:1315` |

## Limits of this map

- 0 service requests use computed names and are not resolved statically.
- Java absences excluded by API level: {}.
- Native code calling back into Java was matched from library strings against a reference android.jar; names built at runtime or encrypted are invisible.
- `supplied` means the provider source answers the contract; `verify` rows need their conformance probe on the board.
- Semantic mismatches (right name, wrong behaviour) remain invisible until a probe or the Android baseline compares them.
